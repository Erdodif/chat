A small prototype repo I made to mess with websockets and Rust. It probably has several security flaws and is highly incomplete.

## Usage

Firstly, rename `.env.example` and fill it out by providing a valid postgres dsn.
Once done, running the server should be as simple as running it using `cargo run` and then opening `static/index.html` twice in two seperate browser tabs to experiment.
